## How to Play

Goal: Reach above and beyond square numbered 100 at the top-left hand corner of the board.

Players begin at square number 1. Each player takes a turn to roll a dice and move them along the numbered squares. If a player lands on a square which has the base of a ladder, they will advance to the square that sits on the top of the ladder.

Similarly, if a player lands on a square which has the head of a snake, it would drop to the tail of the snake.

## Why Snakes & Ladders

When I was young, I played a lot. Everything from board games, donkey cards to remote-controlled cars. I thought how wonderful would it be to design the game that I actually played then. It was meaningful.

Some of the animated characters in this game brought me back to happy memories where I remembered slogging thousands of hours. It was all fun.  Wonderful memories to recollect and one day share with my family.
