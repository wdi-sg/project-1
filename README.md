Project 1: "Are You Smarter Than An Nth Grader?" Quiz Game

"Are You Smarter Than An Nth Grader" is a 2-player, competitive quiz game that tests each player's knowledge across a variety of subjects encompassed in the K-12 education system common to the US, Canada and other countries.

Players take turns to answer the quiz questions, with Player 1 starting the game by default. Each correct answer adds one point to the respective player's score, and play continues until the last question, question 12, is answered.

Subsequently, both player's scores are compared, and the player with the higher score is pronounced the winner! Both players having the same score results in a tie.

A restart button is then generated which allows the game to be restarted.

Future Development Notes:
1. Add game start page
2. Add game over page
3. Add a countdown timer for each round
4. Allow round robbing function (Like how though?)
5. Increase question library and change structure to allow replayability (i.e. questions do not repeat on consecutive playthroughs)
