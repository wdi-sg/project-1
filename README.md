---
### INSTRUCTIONS

 **The game -**
https://ddanielnp.github.io/project-1/

1. To start the game, Press the **O** button. This will start the timer countdown of **60s**

2. The game can be reset by the **P** button

3. **Q** , **W** , **E** , **R** , **T** buttons to add each ingredients

3. A stack of two ingredients will be randomized at the start, with increasing difficulty

4. **10 points** for a completed burger, **-10 points** for a wrong combination

5. The burger should be stacked in order from **bottom up**

6. **Onions** are quite hidden, so look at it carefully

7. **Spacebar** serves the Burger

### Requirements Achieved

* **Single player** game with a score system that suggests challenge

* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display scores**

* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**

* **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**

* **Semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.

### Useful Resources

* **[MDN Javascript Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** _(a great reference for all things Vanilla Javascript)_
* **[jQuery Docs](http://api.jquery.com)** _(if you're using jQuery)_
* **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)** _(for hosting your game)_
* **[How to write readme - Markdown CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)** _(for editing this readme)_
* **[How to write a good readme for github repo!](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)** _(to make it better)_

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
