### Overview

This is a simplified version of the classic card game UNO!. It allows only two players: a human player and the computer player. The players are dealt a deck of cards each and take turn to discard their cards one-by-one according to rules regarding card colors and values. During gameplay if none of a player's cards on hand comply with rules for discard, the player has to draw an additional card from the Draw Pile as penalty. The first player to discard her or his entire deck wins. The game is hosted on GitHub: https://kepler62f.github.io/project-1/assets/
