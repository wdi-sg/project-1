## Gameplay

![screencap](https://github.com/mmmlll/p1_stockbet/blob/master/images/screencapture.png?raw=true)

1. Set the parameters of the game: your wallet size (the amount each person has to invest), and your holding period (number of trading days before today).

2. Research stocks by entering ticker names. For now, only stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange are available. Once you enter a valid ticker, the text area below will display recent news related to the ticker.

> _(Note to game evaluator: live news data not available from within browser due to cross origin issues; the data pulled instead comes from a dummy data in JSON format.)_

3. Based on your research, write up your investment thesis to help you improve over time. Then, enter the ticker of the stock you want to purchase, and click Select Ticker.

4. The second player will repeat steps 2 and 3 above.

5. After both players have entered their stock picks, click Execute Trades to run the database lookup and so determine the winner.

6. Once ready, the results will show at the bottom of the page. __The player whose stock returned the most will be the winner.__
* You may email the results to yourself.
* Use the Facebook button to share the game with your friends!

* Returns an object with voluminous amounts of data (e.g. daily price going back as far as 2014).
* Called back by determineWinner (see below).

#### determineWinner
* Callsback getPrice and manipulates the data object returned ('dataObj').
* Using data from dataObj, populates playersDataArr array with information on the start and end price, start and end dates, return on investment, and wallet size.

## Data Sources and NPM Packages

1. Quandl (quandl.com), an API-enabled financial database, is used to pull price data.

2. The google-news npm package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-news) was used to generate the dummy data used in the news research section.
>_Specifically, I used the link provided in the browser console error log to view the news data (in XML format), converted the XML into JSON, and saved the JSON file into the project directory._

3. The browserify npm package was used to allow Node.JS's "require" to be interpreted in the browser. I wanted to use "require" in order to test more quickly in Node during production.

__Please refer to the PowerPoint in the presentations directory for more information on how the above tools were used.__

#### Technologies used:
```
- Javascript
- Node (during development)
- HTML5
- CSS3

### Known Issues and Areas for Improvement

1. Live news mechanism from google-news npm currently does not work (dummy data used, as mentioned above). Note however that it has been tested and works in the Node environment.
2. Rarely, but sometimes, the _parameters_ object does not seem to render appropriately, and this error is encountered: _"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 1 of undefined at ...determineWinner."_ Closing and re-opening the browser gets rid of the error.
3. Ideally, the news area is cleared and then re-populated when a new ticker is entered. Currently, the new set of news is added below the results of the previous news search.
4. Default email info needs to be rectified.
5. Testing a full set of entries requires many clicks. Build a function that automatically populates the inputs in order to run tests whenever code is updated.
