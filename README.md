### Instructions How To Play

  My Space Invader Game is designed for players who likes to play a never ending game where you rack up points until the player dies. The key to the game is to survive as long as possible while getting points by shooting enemies. The longer you survive more enemies will spawn. It's game over if one of the enemy sprite touches the player sprite. You win by beating your previous score.

### Player Controls

Move Player = Arrow keys

Fire Laser = Spacebar

*Additional Ideas
1. To create additional levels with a variety of difficulty such as faster enemy sprite or enemy with different sizes/radius or higher speed of spawns
2. Add hit point value to both enemy sprites and player sprites for scoring purposes this will allow a 2 player mode where which player can get the higher score in a particular round
