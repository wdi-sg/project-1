# N-Back Memory Game

#Project #1: Dual N-Back

### Overview

The n-back task is a continuous performance task that is commonly used as an assessment in cognitive neuroscience to measure a part of working memory and working memory capacity. The n-back was introduced by Wayne Kirchner in 1958. Credit wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back]

### Game Logic

Game board will consist of 8 square tiles. A location & color button.

A random position and color will appear at 2.5 second intervals. The objective of the game is to remember the location and color of tile that appears one turn back "1-n back" and indicate it by triggering the location or color buttons.  

If player remembers the correct location points will be added and deducted for incorrect.

Each round will last for 20 turns.

### Potential Advancement
1. Improve scoring system.
2. Deduct score for missed matches.
3. Improve visuals.
4. Increase speed between intervals.
5. Increase n variable. (Memorize more steps back)

### User Story

The primary goal of the game is to stress and improve your fluid intelligence with regular practice. Whether or not improvements made in the game are transferable to other areas is debatable.
