# Cubix : The Matching Game

Live prototype here: https://raywtham.github.io/project-1/

### Overview

Cubix as the title suggests, is a matching game.

The player is presented with a game board which is a 4 x 4 grid of cells. Each cell is one of 3 random colours.

The goal of the game is to find matching sequences of 3 cells of the same colour.

### How to play

Click on the first cell in a row or column where 3 cells are of the same colour. Each matching triplet will score 3 points.

Progress to the next level when all possible matches on the grid are found.  

There is a time limit of 60 seconds. Once the time is up, the game will end.

Try to get a higher score each time!

### Initial Project Planning : Pseudo codes

* Use a function to create a 2D array “grid” which is an array with 16 null values to represent a 4 x 4 grid of cells.

* Function gameStart: Generate random numbers between 1 to 3 to populate the array. 1,2,3 will represent “Red”,”Yellow”, “Blue” cells respectively. 
Function Scoring: a function to check scoring condition
		check row: 2 adjacent cells on left or right are the same as active cell -> score
		check column : 2 adjacent cells on top or bottom are the same as active cell - > score 	 		change values of cells which met scoring to 0
		call function isLevelOver

* On click on a cell, run check scoring function

* Function to replenish cells : Loop: Check the array for any cells with value 0. Populate these with the value of the cell above it then change the value of the cell above it to 0.
If there is no cells above i.e top row, generate random numbers to populate cell

* Function to check if game is over: check if there are any matching 3s left on the grid. If yes return false else return true. Add 1 to level counter. If level counter = 7, game ends.

* Function to move to next level: Clears all values in the grid then calls function gameStart.
