# Under the sea

### Gameplay

Move your mouse around to bump into other fishes.
Eating smaller fish will make you bigger,
and bumping into bigger fish will make you smaller.
Make yourself the biggest fish in the sea!

### Approach

Step-by-Step Process

* Create cover page that will disappear upon clicking start button
* Generate fishes at intervals [Stop generating fishes after the 25th fish]
* Fishes must be of different sizes, different initial position, and move randomly [Flipping either left or right]
* Create main fish that follows mouse [And flips left or right]
* Detect collision of main fish with blue fishes
* Increase/Decrease size of main fish when colliding, and make other fish disappear
* Win if bigger than 100x100px, because the biggest blue fish is 110x110px
* Lose if less than 30x30px, because the smallest blue fish is 20x20px

### Functions

**generateFish1()**
* Generate fish of random height (the width will follow proportionately)
* Place new fish at random position (top & left)
* Push new fish to allFishes array

**moveRandomly()**
* For each new fish, have it move to a random new position in a linear transition
* Flip the fish if it is swimming a different direction
* Set 3 different speeds to the fishes

**mouseFish()**
* When the mouse moves, find its new position and have the main fish follow with 0.05 transition
* Flip fish to follow mouse

**collisionDetection()**

if (rect1.x < rect2.x + rect2.width &&
   rect1.x + rect1.width > rect2.x &&
   rect1.y < rect2.y + rect2.height &&
   rect1.height + rect1.y > rect2.y)
    // collision detected!

**collisionResult**

* When collision is detected (true)
* If area of main fish > area of other fish, increase size of main fish
* If area of main fish < area of other fish, decrease size of main fish
* Remove other fish both from the array and the DOM.

**clearFish()**
* Reset fish array to null
* Clear blue fishes from DOM screen

**gameOver()**
* If mainFish reaches 30x30px, clear fish generation and show game over page.
* If mainFish reaches 100x100px, clear fish generation and show winning page.

**startGame()**

* When start button is clicked, remove start items and call the functions to generate new fishes.
* Call collision result every 500ms.
* Calls game over function every 500ms.
* Click replay button to go back to start page

### Roadblocks

**Fishes tend to congregate towards the center after awhile.**

Fixed by increasing interval of calling fish movement, and changing the fish transition instead.

**Fishes are not a regular shape (rectangle or circle), so collision detection is not precise.**

For more accuracy, SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) can be used between convex polygons,
but for simplicity purposes, the fishes are assumed to be rectangles.
Collision detection was improved by setting the interval to detect every 100ms.
