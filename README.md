### Coding logic

The flags in the game are shuffled without duplication for each new play.
Using math.random, I generated a random number for randomIndex. The random number identifies the index for the corresponding arrays in var country and var flags. To prevent duplication, each new number is pushed to a usedIndex array and used to filter new random numbers for duplicated entries.

```
//shuffle image without duplicate for next question
function shuffleImg() {
  randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*5)
  if (usedIndex.length < 5){
  while (usedIndex.includes(randomIndex)) {
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()*5)
  }
  usedIndex.push(randomIndex)
}
  answer = country[randomIndex]
  var flagImage = image[randomIndex]
  var $container = $(".container")
  $container.css("background-image",flagImage)
}
```

### Unsolved problems

* If player scores less than 5 in first try, game restarts at a faster pace and does not score correctly.

---

### Ideas for improvement

* Improve on user interface for answers, produce boxes for each letter that only accepts one character. Allows player to visualise the length with ease.
* To increase grid density and number of flags in shuffle as difficulty increase.
