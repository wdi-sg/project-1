      <h3>Each turn a random location and color will flash on the gameboard. The goal is to memorize the location and color 'n' turns back. Currently n = 1. If the location or color of current turn is the same as that of the previous turn, we should trigger the location or color button</h3><br>
      <h3>Use the left arrow to trigger the location button and the right arrow to trigger color button
      </h3>
