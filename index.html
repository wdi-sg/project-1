            is designed for players who likes to play a never ending game where you
            rack up points until the player dies.
            The key to the game is to survive as long as possible
            while getting points by shooting enemies
            the longer you survive more enemies will spawn.
            It's game over if one of the enemy sprite touches
            the player sprite. You win by beating your previous score.<br><br>

            Player Controls : <br>  Move Player = Arrow Keys <br>   Fire Laser = Spacebar
